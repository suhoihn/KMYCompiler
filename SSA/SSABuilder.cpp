Bottom-up approach(?) (X to its preds and idom parent)
- For this iteration of X, we find 
    "which blocks dominate the predecessor of X, which is P, but doesn't strictly dominate X"
- We know if a node dominates some node K, its domTree ancestors also dominate K. (*)
    - This is essentially the first part required for the definition of DF[ancestor] to have X.
    - Once P dominates X, its ancestors in domTree will.
- So we stop once runner == idom[block] 
    - runner == idom[block] means runner strictly dominates block
    - domTree we can know: A0 - A1 - A2 - A3 - P
                                          ^runner (moves <-)
                                     ^ The one to have == idom[X]
    - All ancestors until runner like A3, P dominates P but doesn't strictly dominate X.
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                          |                             | because it passed the loop condition runner != idom[X]
                          |                             | More specifically, they are the child of the one to have "== idom[X]" (A2)
                          |                             | So they cannot dominate X. So the check runner != idom[X] is sufficient. (Read stuff below.)
                          | because it is walking P's domTree ancestor including P.
                                                        
    - Imagine runner stopped there (A2 == idom[X])
    - Again, automatically A0, A1 disqualifies as having X in DF since it dominates X. (Due to property (*))
*/
/*
Why TF !dom[X].contains(runner) || X == runner <=> idom[X] != runner?
For CFG edge P -> X:

Dominator tree:

             ...
              |
           idom[X]       <- stop here
              |
              A
              |
              P          <- runner starts here

runner walks upward:
    P -> A -> ... -> idom[X]

Every runner on this chain dominates P.

While runner != idom[X], runner is below idom[X] in the dominator tree.
If runner also strictly dominated X, the tree would have to look like:

           idom[X]
              |
           runner
              |
              X

But this is impossible: idom[X] is the immediate dominator of X,
so no other dominator can exist between idom[X] and X.

Therefore, every runner before idom[X] does NOT strictly dominate X.

Special case: runner == X (possible with a loop):

           idom[X]
              |
              X = runner

X does not strictly dominate itself, so it is also valid.

Therefore, in this specific idom-chain walk:

    runner != idom[X]
        <=> runner does not strictly dominate X
        <=> !dom[X].contains(runner) || runner == X

We stop when runner == idom[X], because idom[X] strictly dominates X
and therefore is not in DF[X].

* in simple words, there is a way from X -> Y, but X doesn't dominate Y.

Top-down approach(?) (X to its succs and domTree children)
DF[X] =
    direct places where X's dominance stops
    - say X has pred Y. If idom[Y] != X, X dominance stops at Y. so DF[X].insert(Y)
    - Exactly applies to the condition: 
        - X dominates X, which is a predecessor of Y.
        - X doesn't strictly dominate Y.
            - We only check idom[Y] != X since graph is like X -> Y
        - i.e., path X -> Y is there but X doesn't dominate Y.
    +
    (Tricky case) frontier places inherited from X's dominator-tree children
    - Say X has domTree children Z. (idom[Z] = X)
    - There is obviously a path from X to Z. (X -> ... -> Z)
    - Say DF[Z] has Y.
        - So Z dominates the predecessor of Y.
        - But Z doesn't strictly dominate Y.
    - Then, X's domination may leak for Y. (they are connected but X may not dominate Y)
    - This also applies to the condition: 
        - X dominates Z, so does the predecessor of Y. (Bc of transitivity of dominance.)
            - X dominates Z.
            - Z dominates the predecessor of Y.
            - Thus, X dominates the predecessor of Y.
        - X doesn't strictly dominate Y.
            - Naively, we need to check !dom[Y].contains(X) || X == Y.
            - However, this check can be simplified to idom[Y] != X
            - Why?
                // General condition: X must not strictly dominate Y:
                //     !dom[Y].contains(X) || X == Y
                //
                // Here, Y ∈ DF[Z] and idom[Z] == X.
                // Thus Z dominates a predecessor P of Y, giving a domTree path:
                //
                //     X -> Z -> ... -> P -> Y (p1)
                //
                // If X strictly dominated Y but idom[Y] != X, there would have
                // to be some intermediate dominator A between X and Y:
                //
                //     X -> ... -> A -> Y
                //
                // But A cannot dominate Y because the path above (p1) reaches Y from
                // Z without passing through A. Contradiction.
                //
                // Therefore, in this specific DF propagation case:
                //
                //     X strictly dominates Y  <=>  idom[Y] == X
                //
                // So we can simply check:
                //
                //     idom[Y] != X
        - i.e., path X -> ... -> Z -> ... -> Y exists
        - but X may not strictly dominate Y.
        - So we check idom[Y] != X.
